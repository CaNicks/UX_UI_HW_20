This happened from the Low Fidelity to the High Fidelity where we found things such as increasing font size even more to give the ideal reading experience, To adding auto fill to the form to even further increase the time to apply. We also made changes based off initial feedback to the low fidelity which will be touched on further down the slides.   </p>

            <p class="card-text">Throughout the prototyping process, the team wanted to keep the design as simple as possible, there were a few reason behind this decisions, The first being if they decided to use the prototype we made with a third party, or even make themselves we didn’t want it to be some thing that would required a full time developer to make. The second was the accessibility, since the site is targeted towards older members of society we didn’t want to have anything flashy or to difficult to navigate </p>

            <p class="card-text">To keep accessibility as a main focus, we chose to keep all the colors as either Complimentary or Analogous to not clash. For the text we wanted wide shaped letter without any fancy curves or groves to keep legibility high.</p>

            <p class="card-text">During the design process, the donation button that resided at the ned of the application for volunteers was a big point of contention for the team and the stakeholders. They were very skeptical to remove it despite the multiple user tests that gave remarks saying that it felt weird or inappropriate to ask for money before you even volunteered. This lead to having a few discussion with the stakeholders and after some back and forth agreed it could be changed.  </p>

    <p class="card-text">After completing the High Fidelity, we met with the Stakeholders for a second time to get their opinion on our work. The response was quite positive, they thought the minimized application made the process so much more seamless without compromising the information they were getting. While the homepage they though really gave a better understanding of what their mission was, as this was a big issues they saw was users couldn’t figure out what they did as a non profit. Overall they really liked the prototype and were willing to compromise on the donation button at the end of the application.  Finally they offered to have us completely re-do the entire website if that was something we would be interested in. We are now currently in talks with them about the next steps.</p>
